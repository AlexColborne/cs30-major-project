# Major Project Proposal

The classic game of Tetris. Blocks are dropped into a grid and may be moved and rotated. If a full line is filled by these blocks, the line is cleared.

## Must Have's List
- Use all 7 Tetris shapes
- Blocks must fall automatically
- Completed lines must clear

## Nice to Have List
- Menu Screen
- Options Menu (change volume of music/SFX)
- Pause mid-game
- Ghost block (shows where block will land)
- Up next in the UI
- Ability to hold a block
- Levels (speed increases over time)
- Proper scoring system
- Seperate soft drop and hard drop
- Regulate lock time
- Wall kicks (move the block slightly to allow rotations)
- Use Tetris official randomizer
- Blocks use images instead of p5js coloring
