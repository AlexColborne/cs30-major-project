## Advice to self if I do a project like this again

If I were to do another large scale project, I would want to keep two pieces of advice in mind. The first is to start commenting from the beginning. Though it can be annoying to take a break from what I am doing, it is worth it in the long run to be able to understand why I did certain things in my code. The second is to keep the code structured well. This includes both keeping lots of functions seperate, as well as organizing behaviours into classes instead of leaving a ton of functions all over the place. Mostly this advice revolves around being more organized so that when I come back I can keep going where I left off instead of trying to relearn my own code.

## Hardest Part of Project

The hardest part of the project was having so many grids on top of each other and interacting with each other to make the game work. The game had a grid for blocks that were locked, one for the block that was dropping, several instances of grids created to check if a block could drop, or move sideways, or rotate. There was a grid for the ghost block, there were grids to display the up next and held blocks. Overall the hardest part of the project was creating and combining these 2D arrays in a way that worked effectively.

## Did you Complete the Needs to Have List?

Yes, I completed the 'Need to Have List.' I have all the normal Tetris blocks in my game. The game functions and the blocks drop automatically, or with a manual soft and hard drop. The game has a set lock time so the blocks can be moved after they touch, though this is removed with the hard drop. As lines are cleared, the game speeds up in set levels. These are all the 'Need to Have' features, and I even included many 'Nice to Have' features.


## What are you Most Proud of?

I am most proud of the fact that I was able to complete the project and finish almost every feature that I wanted to include. I am proud of the fact that I had the discipline to work through the whole project, which ended up being over 1600 lines of code.
